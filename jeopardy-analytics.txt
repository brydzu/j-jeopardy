no blank guesses; dd correctors; wager limits; don't let anyone press ENTER on final jeopardy.

Custom games tool. Season 99. Only show them there if they are complete. Otherwise they're only visible to the creating user.
Blast play tracking. Separate accounting ("source" parameter on Guesses) & need Episode-style tracking for Blast. Add the constraints to Questionsets (these would be the equivalent of a Game).

Wager model:
	- my_score
	- other_scores
	- wager
	- player_id
	
Remember to separate out for blast
